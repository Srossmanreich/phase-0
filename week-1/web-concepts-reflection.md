# Web Concepts Reflection

## Bonus Material

Part 1: Based on the resources you looked at, describe the terms you learned about.

Browser: The tool we use in the web to navigate web pages. These browsers (e.g., chrome) call code from remote servers that compile web pages and web apps in the browser on our local devices / clients.
DNS: The Domain Name System that translates domain names into their IP addresses for help finding the correct web pages / apps on the servers we are connecting with.
Domain: The shorthand (vs. IP address) name for webpages / web apps
Internet: The network of wires that connect computers and servers and allow them to communicate with one another
IP address: The ID for all devices linked to the internet (similar to how each person has a cell number)
Web app: A web application that is interactive, constantly updating (such as facebook or airbnb). Often, even users can add information to web apps.
Web server: A device that contains all the information needed to create the beautiful user interfaces we see on the web for web pages and web apps.Our computers communicate with these in order to compile the code needed to create these apps and pages on our own devices.
Website: A page on the internet (usually static)
World wide web: The layer that sits on top of the internet that enables the user interfaces for accessing web pages and web apps by communicating (using the internet) to distant servers holding the code we need for compiling what we seek to view.

Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes.

After we push changes to a webpages, those changes are sent to a server holding all the code for the page. This code on the server is updated so now when anyone types in the webpages' url, the updated code is what is called from the server and displayed to the user.

Part 2: Reflection

What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I learned the different between the web and the internet as well as learned what the internet actually is.

How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
I have created a website before so did not feel anything particularly special when my github page went live. I have never created a webpage through github though and so was extra excited to have learned that.

Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I certainly had a few aha moments while working through git and feel much more comfortable in the command line and git!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
On the internet specifically, no. I thought the resources provided in this bonus material were plenty helpful!
