# Reflections Week 1

## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In looking through all the recommended articles / resources on time-management and productivity, I especially found myself drawn to two related productivity strategies: 1) Timeboxing (allocating a fixed amount of time for working on an activity before taking a break) and 2) the Pomodoro Technique (similar to Timeboxing save work/break pairs come in 25min/5min segments).

Personally I have used Timeboxing to improve my own productivity in the past (and do currently) without having known it was a common strategy (I have dubbed my timeboxing 'sprints' in my own head). But what I hadn't known anything about was all the research and studies around why Timeboxing / the Pomodoro Technique work and why the breaks taken as part of these strategies are so important. Because I have used this technique before and know it works well for me, I will engage it thoroughly throughout phase 0 by setting aside fixed intervals of time for working on phase 0 activities (probably matching fixed time intervals to the easy-medium-hard designations DBC staff link to the various activities).

One reason I have liked to timebox in the past is that I think often (not every time but often enough), after I've started one of my productivity 'sprints', suddenly (particularly when it comes to my writing) I'll enter flow (as described by some of the research linked to) and end up far exceeding the time allocation I had originally set. For me this is a positive thing and has led to mostly awesome breakthroughs in my work. I am excited to see if this also happens for me when I code.

Ultimately though, my overall plan for phase 0 is to get ahead of the work, looking at assignments the day they come out, and plan thoroughly. Fortunately, I have never been a procrastinator and expect my past strategies around productivity to continue to serve me in phase 0.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"

The shell is the user interface we use to run the command line and talk to our computer. Bash is the shell language we are currently using in our command line.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I worry that it will be difficult to remember how to use all these commands particularly if we don't use them in practice much throughout phase 0. It is easy to memorize and follow instructions, but much more difficult to apply learning.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to successfully use all commands.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think help and man are the most important commands as if you are stuck they can show you what commands / arguments exist and how to use them, respectively. This will be very useful for getting comfortable with and learning the command line.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd: shows you the current directory you are working in

ls: lists all the files and directories in the current directory you are in

mv: allows you to rename or move a file

cd: changes directory

../: lets you move back up one directory

touch: creates a new file

mkdir: creates a new directory

less: shows you whats in a file / document / output of a command in pages you can scroll through

rmdir: removes a directory

rm: removes a file / document

help: shows you all available commands built-into the shell
