What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Standard html tags as well as main, section, header, footer, nav, etc. I return to these often because they help organize my html page (which is very useful when the page gets really long and complicated and I start using CSS).

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser goes through the page by starting at the topmost parent, completing all the children in that parent, and then moving onto that parent's sibling. Parents can be inside of parents and will function the same way as the highest parent (but staying within that same highest parent).

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that I can create my own shortcuts in sublime (which is awesome!). I will definitely create more handy snippets (and will do so right now actually!) as well as research existing shortcuts - yay!
