1) What does puts do?
Puts displays your output to the terminal with a new line. It does not actually return what has been put though. The return will be nil.

2) What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number without any decimal places. It can be negative or positive and includes the number 0. A float is a number with deciminal places. For example 0.0 is a float, not an integer.

3) What is the different between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will always return an integer (rounding down). In other words if you divide 11 by 2, the answer returned will be the whole number 5. Whereas if the division had used floats (11.0 / 2.0) the result would have been 5.5 (another float).

If I was explaining this to someone who was not a programmer, I would tell them that when you divide expect a decimal place only if the division involved numbers with decimal places.
