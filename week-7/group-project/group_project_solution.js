Release 1: Tests to User Stories (Sydney)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Based on the tests, write user stories that describe what the 
code needs to do. User stories take the following format:

As a user, I want to...

The user stories should be easily translated into 
pseudocode by the next person in your group. However, a user 
story is NOT pseudocode -- it should describe the experience 
of someone using the function. Words like array or loop or any 
word not known to a non-technical person should not be used. You 
can specify the function name.

ANSWER:

As a user, I want to be able to use a command called "sum" to
add up all the values within a set, whether the set has an even
number of values in it or an odd number of values in it.

As a user, I want to be able to use a command called "mean" to
find the average of all the values within a set, whether the 
set has an even number of values in it or an odd number of values 
in it.

As a user, I want to be able to use a command called "median" to
find the median of all the values within a set, whether the set 
has an even number of values in it or an odd number of values in it.
