Questions for text box

Introduction:

1) Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in 
general?

I learned more about the history of computing / computer science
as well as specifically javascript.

2) Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?

Not specific concepts no, but what always worries me is how fast
computing and languages change. Javascript, JS tools, libraries,
etc. are so expansive and there is so much to learn sometimes I
just feel overwhelmed.

Ch.1: Values, Types, and Operators

1) Identify two similarities and two differences between 
JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, 
strings, booleans, and various operators.

Well it appears for the most part strings, numbers, and booleans
act the same in JS as they do in ruby. I did notice some key
differences: for example javascript tries to convert numbers
written as strings to actual numbers at times when it is
confused (e.g., console.log("5" - 1) will actually print 4 to
the console). JS also has two undefined data types not in ruby:
null and undefined that can be used in operations.

Ch. 2: Program Structure

1) What is an expression?
2) What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they 
always required?
3) What causes a variable to return undefined?
4) Write your own variable and do something to it in the 
eloquent.js file.
5) What does console.log do and when would you use it? What 
Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
6) Write a short program that asks for a user to input their 
favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond 
with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need 
to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) 
rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). 
Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.
7) Describe while and for loops
8) What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?
9) Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.
