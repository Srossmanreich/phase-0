What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  - Information Gathering
  - Planning
  - Design
  - Development
  - Testing and Delivery
  - Maintenance
  
  What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
      
  My site's primary goal will be to show off my work to those interesting in me (for hire or for other reasons). I hope my site will feature information about me, my contact information, links to my blogs, as well as links to the projects I am working on.
  
  What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  
  My target audience should be interested in me and my work! They'll want to learn more about me and the projects I have created. In order to help my audience navigate these, I plan to make my projects front and center on my site.
  
  What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  
  My user's primary action should be clicking to my projects. A secondary action will be to contact me / follow me on social media.
  
  What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  
  With user design and experience it is important to remember that many features will impact a user's ability to access and harness your page. The site should be functional, aesthetically pleasing, and have a clear call-to-action (what is the user meant to do?).
  
  What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  
  User experience design is all about creating a page (or any sort of product) with the user's experience with that page/product in mind first --- essentially building something for your audience (enabling them to very easily and enjoyably take the action you want)
  
  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  
  It wasn't immediately obvious to me how to insert an image into the page using the relative path and I was unsure whether our reflection should just be a normal text doc or in html (I opted for the latter)
