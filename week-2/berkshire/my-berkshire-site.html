<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Surprisingly easy! And it made me feel great when everything worked!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Also surprisingly easy. I basically just typed my questions into google with my pair partner and what we were looking for came up right away.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was difficult not to do any formatting given that our site ended up not exactly looking like the Berkshire site, but I know styling is coming!

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is pretty straight forward, but there is a lot of detail and it is easy to forget a "/" or a tag which can screw up an entire page.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
One trick I like is automatically closing tags as you write them (rather than waiting until you've filled in the content). This helps me to remember to always close my tags.
